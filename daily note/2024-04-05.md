Signature matrix create a large number of hash function (not minhash) 
create bucket  for each pair in bucket 
a pairs became a can pair if 2 or more are in a bucket  
cannot used too many bucket  
how similar 
pick a similarity threhold t, a fraction <1 
we want a pair of columns c and d of the signature matrix M to be a candidate pair if and only if the signatures agree in at least frac
