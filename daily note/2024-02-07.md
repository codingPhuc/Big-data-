model 6 
advanced concepts 

## introduction what is Sql 
- a languge use for raltional databases  
- sql is short for structure query language 
# what is data 
data is a set of information in the form of facts  , pictures , one of the most essential 
## what is a database 
a repository of data 
provides the functionaliyt for adding , modifying , and organize data 

## realtional database 
[[]
FilmLocations(
Title:              titles of the films,

##  Relational Database Concepts 
## what you will learn 
explain the advantage of the relational mode  ? 
- the key advantage of the relational model is data independence 
explain how the entity name and attributes map to a relational database table ?
- entities are independent objects which have attributes 
describe the difference between an entity and an attribute ?
- entities  map to table in a relational database  
- attributes map to columns in a table 
identify some commonly used data types ?  
- common data types include characters , numbers , and dates/times 
 describe the function of primary keys ? 
- A Primary key uniquely identifies a specific row in a table 
## Relational model 
- most used data model 
- allows for data independence 
- data is stored in  tables
![[table.PNG]] 
## Entity Relationship Model 
- Used as a tool  to design relational databases 
- the entity book have attribute like book title the addition of the book the year the book is written attribute is connect to one entity 
- the attribute become a column in a table 
- mapping entity diagram to table 
- entities become table 
- attribute get translated into columns 
- each attribute store value in differeent format

each table is assign a primary key 
the primary key is used to identify enties in a table 
table is also include foreign key provided in a table connecting relation ship between table 



what you package need to be learn in python 
class 
numpy 
pandas matplotlib 
scipy 
matlab notebook jupyter notebook 
big data analysis 
the python connect to the note book using api 

aplication program interface for the ddbms 
application program call function using the the api

# built in functions 
most databases come with built in sql function 
built in functions can be included as part of sql statement 
database function  can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved 
can speed up data processing 
## Average function 
Average function is function that perform an operation then return 1 value or null , example of Average function are SUM , MIN , MAX AVG ... 
you can also can do mathematics operation on the average function an example of this include 
```
select AVG(COSt/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE 
where ANIMAL  = 'Dog' 
```
- the code above will divide the cost then avg the column 
## SCALAR AND STRING FUNCTIONS 
 SCALAR : Perform operations on every input value 
 Examples : ROUND() , LENGTH () , UCASE ,  LCASE

## BUILT IN DATAABSE FUNCTIONS 
most databases come with built in Sql functions 
built in function can be include as part of SQL statements 
database function  can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved 
can speed up data processing 



## build in date function in sql 
### SQL Server DATEADD() Function 
The DATEADD() function adds a time/date internal to a data then return the date 
```
SELECT DATEADD(month, -2, '2017/08/25') AS DateAdd;
```
 
## Sub-queries and Nested Selects 
Sub-query :  A query inside another query 

Subsititute column name with a sub-query 
called column Expressions 

```
select EMP_ID , SALARY , AVG(SALARY) AS AVG_SALARY  
	from employees 
```

```
SELECT EMP_ID , SALARY , 
(SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEESS)
AS AVG_SALARY  
FROM EMPLOYEES
```
- this code will output the average employee as a column that next to the emp_id and salary 
- this will prevent the query group by cause which output avg bases on id
