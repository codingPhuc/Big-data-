# parallel processing 

![[parrele processing.PNG]]
- the problem is split into different instruction , because the problem is being run on different execution node 
- error can be fix and execute locally  
why parallel processing is apt for big data 
Parallel processing advantages 
- Parallel processing approach can process large dataset in a fraction of time 
- less memory and compute requirement needed as set of instruction are distributed to smaller execution nodes 
- More execution nodes can be added or removed from the processing network depending on complexity of the problem
