Today’s course is related to **High Dimensional Data**.

In the realm of big data, vectors often need to be high dimensional. Given a query image patch, the task is to find similar images.

**Data Transformation** is the process of transforming data from one form to another, usually into vector form. There are different types of vectors, such as feature vectors and embedding vectors.

In computer science, we prefer to transform data from any type to numeric for easier processing and analysis.

Here are some common mathematical formulas used in data analysis:
# distance  equation 

- **Euclidean Distance**:
$$d(p,q) = \sqrt{(p_1-q_1)^2 + (p_2-q_2)^2 + \cdots + (p_n-q_n)^2}d(p,q)=(p1​−q1​)2+(p2​−q2​)2+⋯+(pn​−qn​)2$$​
    
- **Manhattan Distance**:
    
     $$d  (p,q) = |p_1-q_1| + |p_2-q_2| + \cdots + |p_n-q_n|d(p,q)=∣p1​−q1​∣+∣p2​−q2​∣+⋯+∣pn​−qn​∣$$
    
- **Cosine Distance**:
      $$d  (p,q) = 1 - \frac{p \cdot q}{||p||_2 ||q||_2}d(p,q)=1−∣∣p∣∣2​∣∣q∣∣2​p⋅q$$
    

These formulas are used to calculate the distance or similarity between vectors, which is crucial in many data analysis tasks.
