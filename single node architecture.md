In a single-node architecture, algorithms are executed on the CPU, and data access is directly from memory, eliminating the need for data reloading.

## Data Loading Impact

When data needs to be loaded again, traditional data mining algorithms often retrieve data from disk, leading to significant processing delays. For instance, consider a scenario from Google:

- 10 billion web pages with an average size of 20 KB each result in 200 TB of data.
- The data bandwidth between the storage and CPU (disk read bandwidth) is 50 MB/sec.
- Reading the entire dataset would take approximately 4 million seconds, equivalent to 46 days.
- The time required to perform meaningful operations with the data further extends this duration.

## Optimization through Parallel Processing

To address this challenge, parallel processing is employed. By distributing the data across multiple disks and CPUs, the workload is significantly reduced. For example, using 4 million CPUs to read the data concurrently would shorten the time to around 4000 seconds, approximately one hour. This approach enhances efficiency by harnessing the power of parallelism in data processing.
